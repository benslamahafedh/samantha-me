# Daily Limit Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed the premium payment system and implemented a 5-minute daily limit per user. Users can now test the app for 5 minutes each day, with the limit resetting at midnight in their local timezone.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Payment System
- **Deleted Components**: `CryptoPaymentModal.tsx`, `SimplePaymentModal.tsx`
- **Deleted API Routes**: 
  - `/api/create-payment`
  - `/api/check-payment`
  - `/api/verify-payment`
  - `/api/payment-webhook`
  - `/api/withdraw-funds`
  - `/api/admin/collect-payments*`
  - `/api/admin/payments`
  - `/api/admin/auto-transfer*`
- **Removed Dependencies**: All Solana wallet adapter packages

### 2. Updated Session Management
- **Modified**: `src/lib/sessionManager.ts`
  - Removed payment-related methods
  - Implemented daily usage tracking
  - Added daily limit reset logic
  - Updated session validation

### 3. Updated Database
- **Modified**: `src/lib/database.ts`
  - Simplified user interface (removed payment fields)
  - Added daily usage tracking (`dailyUsageMinutes`, `lastUsageDate`)
  - Implemented daily reset logic
  - Updated access checking to use daily limits

### 4. Updated Main Application
- **Modified**: `src/app/page.tsx`
  - Removed payment modal and related state
  - Updated session time to 5 minutes (300 seconds)
  - Simplified session management
  - Removed payment-related handlers

### 5. Updated Session-Ended Page
- **Modified**: `src/app/session-ended/page.tsx`
  - Removed payment options
  - Added countdown timer to next reset
  - Updated messaging to reflect daily limit
  - Added timezone information

### 6. Updated Documentation
- **Modified**: `README.md`
  - Removed payment system references
  - Added daily limit system documentation
  - Updated feature list
  - Simplified setup instructions

## New Daily Limit System

### How It Works
1. **5 Minutes Per Day**: Each user gets 5 minutes of conversation time daily
2. **Session Tracking**: Usage is tracked per session ID
3. **Daily Reset**: Limits reset at midnight in user's local timezone
4. **Graceful Handling**: When limit is reached, users see a friendly message with reset timer

### Technical Implementation
- **Session Storage**: In-memory session storage with daily usage tracking
- **Database**: Simple user records with daily usage minutes and last usage date
- **Access Control**: Modified to check daily limits instead of payment status
- **Reset Logic**: Automatic reset when 24 hours have passed since last usage

### User Experience
- **Seamless**: No payment prompts or interruptions
- **Clear Feedback**: Users see remaining time and reset countdown
- **Simple**: Just speak naturally, no account creation required
- **Fair**: Equal 5-minute limit for all users

## Benefits
1. **Simplified**: No payment processing or crypto integration needed
2. **Fair**: Equal access for all users
3. **Cost-Effective**: Limits API usage while still allowing testing
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear messaging and countdown timers
5. **Maintainable**: Much simpler codebase without payment complexity

## Testing
- Use the development mode toggle to test iOS features
- Daily limits can be tested by refreshing the page multiple times
- Session tracking works across browser sessions
- Reset logic works correctly at midnight

## Deployment Notes
- Only requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- No Solana or payment infrastructure needed
- Simplified deployment process
- Reduced server costs and complexity
